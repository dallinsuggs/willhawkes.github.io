      Hello, my name is Dallin, and here is the story of how I and my wife Nelli met and formed a family. I grew up
      in Sacramento, CA in the United States, and Nelli grew up in Kölesd, Hungary.

        Way back, a mere two and a half years ago, I was just approaching the final weeks of serving a mission in
        Hungary for the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-Day Saints. One of the missionaries I knew mentioned a pretty
        girl to me that he and his companion were meeting with that day. I didn't think much of it. Meanwhile, he told
        this girl all about myself. After coming home from my mission, Nelli added me as a friend on Facebook and we
        started getting to know each other via video calls and messages. That summer she visited Utah, where I was
        then living, and we got to spend two weeks together.

        Right at the end of Nelli's visit to the US, we submitted the paperwork for her to get a fiancée visa, with
        which she would then be able to move to Utah permanently and we could get married. Following submitting the
        paperwork, a painfully slow and agonizingly long 5 months trundled by before the application was approved,
        and after that another 2 months before she was called in for an interview. Fortunately we were able to
        alleviate the difficulty of each other's extended physical absence when I visited Hungary at the end of that
        year.

        After another two weeks together (this time in Hungary) Nelli was finally able to go to her interview, and
        they granted her the visa! Only two months after my visit to Hungary she was back in the US again, this time
        with all of her belongings, here to stay. The next several days were a busy time, and on February 25th of 2020
        we were married! We of course had an amazing time, and while Nelli's family members couldn't be present, she
        already befriended some of my extended family who were there to support us.

        While in America Nelli discovered In 'n' Out, one of my personal favorite restaurants, and she fell in love
        with it much as I. So of course, only minutes after pictures were taken following the wedding, we had to stop
        by for a tasteful (tasty?) photo in our wedding getups at the locale venue. Fortunately a kind soul was
        available to act as cameraman, and now we can look back fondly at this moment.

        Time passed, but not too much time, and we added someone to our family. Elanor Vivien Suggs was born at the
        end of the same year right in the middle of the COVID19 craze. Since then she has grown a lot, and so have we
        (her in size and mental capacity, we in patience and the like). We love each other and feel incredibly blessed
        that Nelli's immigration worked out (after a lot of blood sweat and tears, as they say) and we are able to be
        together.
