        <p>
          Dallin Suggs founded Flip University in early 2021. With plenty of flipping experience under his

          Welcome to Flip University's official website! Here you can find information about our different
          departments as well as demonstrations of the proud work of our founder and the students! Currently
          we boast an athletics department (our main focus), a general academics section, and last but not
          least, an art department as well.
